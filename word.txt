In the solitude of night, stars speak hidden stories.
Dreams dance on the margins of sleeping minds.
Time gently tiptoes, weaving moments into its grasp.
Silence says volumes and echoes in the heart chamber.
Shadows play hide-and-seek with the light's delicate touch, as the world hums its unending melody.
