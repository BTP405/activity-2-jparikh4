The explanation of three approaches are:

Approach 1: The following code implements a function doubleL(n) that accepts an integer n as input and uses a for loop to build a list of doubled values ranging from 0 to n-1. The function finally returns the list. The for loop outside the method calls doubleL(5) and outputs each item in the resulting list, followed by a colon.

Approach 2: The following code employs a list comprehension to generate a list of doubled numbers from 0 to 4 (range(5)). The for loop then iterates over this list, printing each member and ending with a colon.

Approach 3: In the following code, using the yield keyword, this technique creates the generator function doubleG(n). The generator returns doubled values for integers ranging from 0 to n-1. The for loop outside the method calls doubleG(5) and outputs each result, followed by a colon.

DoubleG(n) function means is a generating function. In Python, generator functions employ the yield keyword to generate a series of values lazily, i.e., one at a time, rather than constructing a list of all values at once.

--- Advantages :

Memory Efficiency:

Generators save memory by producing values instantly rather than storing them all at once.
Particularly useful for dealing with huge datasets when saving all values at once may be problematic.
Generators often require less memory than list-based techniques like doubleL and doubleG.
On-Demand Generation:    * Values are created based on demand removing the predetermined and stored data.

This generator can minimize memory overhead, particularly for long or endless sequences/series.
Generators provide superior performance, particularly when only a subset of data is needed.

They avoid the burden of initial calculation and storage, resulting in speedier execution, especially in resource-constrained contexts.
